# SnapchatWall
SnapchatWall is a collection of independent programs that collectively create a system that stores snaps, 
checks them and then displays the images on a screen or canvas.

## 1.0) Important Infos
### 1.1) Software needed
* Android Emulator (I have used [Nox Player](https://www.bignox.com/))
* [Windows 10](https://i.imgflip.com/raseo.jpg) (Sorry, I had to use Windows because it provides the simplest method for making screenshots and controlling the mouse)
* [SnapchatBot](https://github.com/Dafnik/SnapchatWall/tree/master/SnapchatBot) - Open and saves snaps
* ContentFilter - Filters saved snaps and moves them to other directories
* SnapDisplay - Shows snaps in an endless cycle

### 1.2) Hardware needed
* Minimal requirement are two computers (better three) running [Windows 10](https://i.imgflip.com/raseo.jpg)
* You should have a shared folder (or a [NAS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Attached_Storage)) in your network, so all computers are connected between each other

### 1.3) Technical infos
* All three components are written in [C#](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Sharp)
* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for programming everything
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) for compliling the project on my destination computer
